                <p class="Interests"> Since middle school I have always been a runner at heart. While, I have tried
                    other
                    sports such as
                    football, basketball, and baseball, I have always came back to the thing they all have in common.
                    I started with cross country and quickly realized I was more of a sprinter.My passion for it took me
                    into track & field, where I focused on the 400m. Running is so much more than going out and moving
                    your
                    legs,
                    it is honestly a lot nerdier than it seems. You have to be intune with your body.

                <p class="Interests"> It is a sport that has been up and coming in the past few years but I have played
                    SpikeBall for around 6
                    years now. I met a good group of friends doing it and I have even traveled for tournaments competing
                    with international teams as well as colleges.
                    If you are not familiar with Spikeball think of it like volleyball but instead of passing the ball
                    over
                    a net you bounce it off a central net placed on the ground. In 2022 I was ranked #55 out of 100
                    Spikeball Players in the state of Texas.

                <p class="Interests"> The outdoors wasn't always something that I loved. I had to be exposed to it.
                    Growing
                    up, my family has
                    taken multiple vacations to Colorado to get out of our normal scene in the city. I have ziplined
                    over
                    the mountains, white water rafted, hiked through waterfalls, and just simply allowed myself to exist
                    in
                    nature. I've also spent a week in a yurt by the ocean in Oregon. Some of my favorite outdoor
                    activities
                    are hiking, kyaking, and rock climbing. Next, I want to try skydiving.

                <p class="Interests"> Before I could remember I have always loved gaming. I grew up playing Fifa and
                    Skyrim
                    with my uncle.
                    Then, it led to my dad and I finding a common interest when Destiny The Game released. I think what
                    really got me into gaming is the community that it can bring between people. It is hard to
                    understand
                    unless you have experienced it. To this day my dad and I still play Destiny together and we even
                    have
                    our old characters on the Playstation from since I was a kid. I've even been able to make money off
                    of gaming.
